# Implementation of Nested Sampling on Light House Problem

## Light house Problem Statement
#### 2D Problem
A lighthouse is somewhere off a piece of straight coastline at a position α along the shore and a distance β out at sea. It emits a series of short highly collimated flashes at random intervals and hence at random azimuths. These pulses are intercepted on the coast by photo-detectors that record only the fact that a flash has occurred, but not the angle from which it came. N flashes have so far been recorded at positions {x<sub>k</sub>}. Where is the lighthouse?’

#### 3D Problem
An analogous problem in 3D so that the lighthouse is now at a position (α, β, γ) and the flashes are emitted at random azimuths and polar angles. The photo-detectors are now located at positions {x<sub>k</sub>, y<sub>k</sub>}. Where is the lighthouse?’

## Nested Sampling
Nested Sampling is a computational method for Bayesian inference. It is a Monte Carlo method developed by physicist John Skilling in 2004.
